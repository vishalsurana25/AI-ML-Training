Problem:

For bar coupon and coffee coupon offers, what users were more likely to accept (use) the coupon (eg we were able to drive an action to). Explore what characteristics had the most acceptance, and what patterns we might be able use in the future to drive the most utilization of our coupon marketing campaigns.

Findings:
1. Only about 4 out of 10 people are down for bar coupons. (That's like 41%)
2. If you're a regular at bars, you're more likely to take a coupon compared to those who don't go as often.
3. People over 25 who go to bars a lot are more into coupons (70% of them).
4. Drivers without kids and with no window preference are more likely to grab a coupon.
5. Drivers heading to a cheap restaurant and your income is under 50K, coupons acceptance is below 50%

Final Summary:

Individuals who frequent bars at least once monthly are significantly more likely to redeem bar coupons. Furthermore, those who are unmarried, childless, and under the age of 30 exhibit an increased propensity to accept such offers. Additionally, individuals accompanied by friends or partners who are headed home or lack a specific destination are more inclined to accept coffee house coupons. The highest acceptance rates occur during the afternoon and evening hours, specifically from 2pm to 10pm.
